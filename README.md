# FallsTimeSeries
Time Series Fall Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting falls using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data formatted into time series multiindex. The goal is to leverage the time series nature of the data to build a robust predictive model that can identify the likelihood of falls. The project includes two main components:

Fall_Pred_Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for training and constructing the fall prediction model.
Fall_Pred_Model_eval.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for evaluating the performance of the fall prediction model.

Open Fall_Pred_Model_eval.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells in sequence to evaluate the model.
Evaluation results will be saved in the results/ directory.
